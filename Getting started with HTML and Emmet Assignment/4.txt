 # List out any 3 tags we learned in this module and give a brief explanation about the tags

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. <h> (Heading Tags):
    Purpose:
     1. Heading tags are used to define headings or titles for sections of content on a web page.
     2. They provide a hierarchical structure to the content, with <h1> being the highest level (most important) and <h6> the lowest.
    Example: 
        <h1>This is a Heading 1</h1>

2. <p> (Paragraph Tag):
    Purpose: 
     1. The <p> tag defines paragraphs of text on a web page.
     2. It is used to separate and format text content into paragraphs, creating visual spacing between them.
    Example: 
        <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>

3. <strong> (Strong Tag):
    Purpose:
     1. The <strong> tag is used to indicate strong emphasis on text content.
     2. Typically, browsers display text enclosed in <strong> tags as bold, highlighting its importance.
    Example:
        <p>This text is <strong>strongly emphasized</strong>.</p>

4. <em> (Emphasis Tag):
    Purpose: 
    1. The <em> tag is used to indicate emphasis on text content. 
    2. Browsers often display text enclosed in <em> tags as italicized, suggesting a change in tone or stress on the content.
    Example: 
        <p>This text is <em>emphasized</em>.</p>

These tags play a crucial role in structuring and formatting content on web pages, making it easier to read and understand while conveying the intended meaning and hierarchy of the information.
